Community Framework is also extremely open, and virtually anyone can contribute to it [url=https://github.com/JamesTheMaker/Community-Framework]here[/url].\n\nThis mod adds nothing new to the gameplay itself, however, and instead you should explore some of the mods which use/support Community Framework [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2968438274/4040357717321539261]here[/url]!\n\nSome of the functions include:\n[list]\n    [*]Fully dynamic collections UI!\n    [*]Infinitely extendable Unipad!\n    [*]Custom power system!\n    [*]Item processors and assemblers!\n    [*]Powered machinery!\n    [*]And more to come!\n[/list]",
