  "description" : "Community Framework is a mod that adds new scripts and functionality to Starbound for other modders to use and build upon. Community Framework is also extremely open, and virtually anyone can contribute to it [url=https://github.com/JamesTheMaker/Community-Framework]here[/url].\n\nIt also includes some changes and adjustments, i.g. enabling biome transitions and improving threat descriptions. However, the mod adds nothing to the gameplay itself. Instead, other mods which use the functionality of Community Framework is required.\n\nSome of the functions include:\n[list]\n    [*]Fully functional power system\n    [*]Item processors\n    [*]Powered machinery\n    [*]And more to come!\n[/list]",
